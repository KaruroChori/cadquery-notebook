# Cadquery utils
A jupyter notebook with some functions and classes to make my life easier.  
While most of the code could be used outside jupyter, it has been integrated to provide some user interface.  
This notebook is self-documented.

Please refer to https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery and https://github.com/bernhard-42/jupyter-cadquery to know more about **cadquery** and how to install it.
